# Sagisawa

Sagisawa is a replacement to [xCubed](https://github.com/LandenStephenss/xCubed), it was about time for a rebranding anyways so i found an anime profile picture and randomly generated an anime name.

# Installation

1. Clone the bot by using `git clone https://github.com/sagisawa-org/Sagisawa`

2. Create a `config.json` file, this file should contain the following
```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_BOTS_TOKEN",
    "developers": ["YOUR_ID", "OTHER_DEVS_ID", "IF_YOU_HAVE_ONE"],
    "prefix": "s!",
    "mongoUrl": "THE_CONNECTION_STRING_TO_MONGODB"
}
```

3. You should now be able to start the bot using `npm run start`, unless of course i uploaded bad code. If so just open an issue [here](https://github.com/sagisawa-org/Sagisawa/issues)
